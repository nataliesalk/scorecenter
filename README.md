Assignment Five 

heroku app--- http://desolate-peak-8993.herokuapp.com

Correctly Implemented 
-  CORS
- /submit.json with the three mandatory fields game_title, username, and score 
- / the index, it displays a list of all of the scores, users, game titles and dates played 
- /submit.json works properly 
- /highscores.json returns the top then scores and /highscores.json?game_title=frogger returns the 
top ten scores for frogger in descending order 
- /usersearch works well, there is a textbox and a submit button and it returns the scores for 
the specified username
-i have a .gitignore file in my repo 


Problems
-/highscore.json if there is not more ten scores that are greater than eachother it will instert lower 
scores to fill in the limit of ten scores with lower scores  and it will put words above number too.
